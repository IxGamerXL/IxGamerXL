Sup. I'm mainly a solo developer in several languages, and code random stuff until I am satisfied, or completely overwhelmed. Don't get thrown off by my independancy however, as I am just as fine working in teams.

I also make graphics, albeit probably simple. I usually steer clear of Copy&Pasting whenever possible, and use my own methods and code instead.

I currently know these languages:

- Lua (since 2020~)
- Javascript (since 2021~)
- _HTML (since 2021~) (not really a language but still)_
- Python (since 2023~)
- Java* (since 2023~)
- C* (since 2023)

_*Recent and/or currently learning more of the language._

_~May not be accurate, memory of when it was first learned is quite fuzzy._
