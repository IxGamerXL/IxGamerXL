### Oh... you're here.

Well, I can't seem to accurately specify what you want from me, but you *are* in my page. Perhaps you wanted to see some lore as well as know me.

I am Green Stickfigure *(AKA: GSF)* and something you should know about me is how my creativity sparks to no end. *(Lore/canon-wise)* My lightbulb is a sign of my sheer determination and spark of creativity. It's also been a vital part of me, part of my soul. My soul and it's connections are completely unbreakable, no matter how severe and dire things may be. Determination keeps both my soul and my lightbulb from being composed to shrapnel.

If you know me, you likely know me from the communities in which I usually am in, such as Mindustry DDNS. With an ever-expanding knowledge database, it may appear that I'm really smart, but I'm not. Doesn't mean I don't make some very epic code (despite what ASimple says). I am especially humble in when it comes to moderation and I use proper speach in places applicable, and often work as a moderator of anywhere I'm interested, especially when there seems to be too many reports gone missing on the one specific server.

Also, I am not Alan Becker's green stickfigure, please don't mix the two up.

**...**

*Could you leave me now? I am busy.*
