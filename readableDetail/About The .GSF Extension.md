# .GSF Extension

The `.GSF` extension is not particularly defined automatically, and is a odd one at that.

It consists of the current languages GSF has learned:

- Lua *(Basic+ Programming)*
- Javascript *(Basic Programming)*
- Java *(Free-form Programming)*
- Batch *(File Handler && Windows Programming)*
- VBS *(Basic Dialogs && Windows Programming)*
- HTML *(Framework)*

The `.GSF` extension cannot be used by other files or programs unless authorized by the creator of GSF.

## Who's the creator (lore-wise)?

...Not yet.
